Based on the XYZ layer type already implemented in the OpenLayers module, this module adds extra configurations. For example, as it stands right now, it lets you add a XYZ layer as a overlay, or as the default base layer already found in the OpenLayers module. The isBaseLayer option might be best maintained in OpenLayers directly, so this is just a sandbox project.
